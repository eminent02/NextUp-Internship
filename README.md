Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning is the project done under NextUp Internship.

# Description

Credit card frauds are easy and friendly targets. E-commerce and many other online sites have increased the online payment modes, increasing the risk for online fraud. Since the increase in fraud rates, we have used different machine learning methods to detect and analyze fraud in online transactions. The main aim of the project is to design and develop a novel fraud detection method for Transaction Data, with an objective, to analyze the past transaction details of the customers and extract the behavioral patterns. Different classifiers are trained over the past transaction details. And then the classifier with a better rating score can be chosen to be one of the best methods to predict frauds. In this project, we worked with the European credit card fraud dataset.
